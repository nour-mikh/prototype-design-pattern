G- Allows you to change the current selected color by using a color wheel
C- Clears the screen and canvas
Q- Quits the program

All the panels aside from "current color" are interactive, they can be used by circling around the
panel, swiftly hiding the detected object and then showing the object, which would
change colors, clear all, change widths or select the eraser

A circle on the top right helps vizualize the current selected width and color. However
a current color hexagone is also avaible to showcase current colors while using small
widths
